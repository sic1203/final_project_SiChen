# Final_Project_SiChen
This is the final project page for my **Telling Stories with Data** Class at Carnegie Mellon University.

# ***Part I***    
**Outline**  
Over the last several decades, China has achieved rapid economic growth, accompanied by the rapid development of the real estate market. As a result of rapid economic growth and urbanization, demands for urban land and new dwellings have increased rapidly, leading to rapid growth of housing prices. My final project will go to visualize the Beijing Housing Price data. I will use several graphs to visualize the whole data or some of interesting part to convey a vivid and clear data visualization to my audience. My main topic is what contributes to the high housing price most. Some points I will have in my final project is the measurement in different elements among different houses, such as the building type and the equipment.  

As a reader, I want my reader, or my audience will learn that the different factors that are impacting the housing price in Beijing so that they can have some insights to thinking why this factor does affect the price. 

MY audience
**Main Elements of my Final Project**  
  * Housing Price Overview (Yearly Change/ Distribution)  
  * What factors are the main reason for the difference in housing price  
  
**Datasets**

This datasets collect a lot of house selling and renting information from Lianjia, a major Chinese estate agency. It contains almost 100 thousand observations. The main attributes I will use to storytelling is the price, square, living room, drawing room, kitchen, bathroom, floor, building type, renovationCondition, building structure, and elevator.  

**Method and medium**  
I will use Shorthand to deliver my whole final project because I think it is a convenient tool to help us visualized our data and conveyed our ideas. We can use a very narrative way to explaining our data from simple to complex.  

By inserting interesting pictures and our graphs, we can give our audience a better understanding of our idea and data.

I am hoping I can create excellent and meaningful data visualization to my audience in the next two weeks. Even though I haven't processed my data yet, I believe it will give us a lot of insights. Let's wait and see!
